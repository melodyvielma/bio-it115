I am Melody Vielma, I am nineteen years old and I am a student at Seattle Central and I'm in the Year Up program. I'm in the Applications Development track where I plan to apply the skills that I learn to land myself a job as a Junior Develper. My main goal is to work for a big and ethical company. After I complete the Year Up program I am going to take the initiative to expand my skills in JavaScript and learn some Python so I can have more advanced knowledge in what I do so I can provide better service to my clients. In highschool I was a very applicated student and graduated with a 4.07 GPA and was in the top 5% of my class of approximately 600 students. My ambition always drove me to dedicate many hours to homework and studying time so that I could always be one of the best students in my classes. I faced many obstacles throughout my years in high school, such as constantly moving schools in different states. This should have negatively affected my grades in school and my mental health overall, but I stayed determined and maintained my good grades. I believe this is a skill that can reflect on my professional career as well because I enjoy challenges and they incline me to do my best.
